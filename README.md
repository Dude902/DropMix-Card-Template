# Dropmix-Card-Template
Conversion of my photoshop-based template for Dropmix musical trading card mockups to a web-based image creator. The world's only Dropmix card mockup template.
<BR>
<UL>To do list (loosely in order):
  <LI>Draw text as soon as it loads instead of waiting.</LI>
  <LI>Make the text boxes and other inputs more immediately responsive to changes.</LI>
  <LI>Allow uploading card art and moving/resizing/rotating.</LI>
  <LI>Add a "restore default" button.</LI>
</UL>
<BR>
<UL>Bugs:
  <LI>Kerning is wrong but is correct after soft-refreshing (maybe fonts loaded incorrectly?)</LI>
</UL>
